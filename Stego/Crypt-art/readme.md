This challenge gave a a PPM file, after ```display``` it using ```imagemagick```, it returned to me a colorful picture.

I searched on google and learned it is a type code named **```Piet```** .After reading the file, i obtain this material: "The encrypted pass is: EPCQFBXKWURQCTXOIPMNV".  
I decoded a picture using [Npietonline](https://www.bertnase.de/npiet/npiet-execute.php) and found that the key is EYJFRGTT but it is not a flag.  
Based on the encrypted pass and the key, i realized it's related to the **[Vigen√®re Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher)**.
After matching them and solving it using GPT, i obtained a flag.
