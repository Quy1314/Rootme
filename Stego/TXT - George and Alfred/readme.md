After translating and reading a poem, I came across the line "lisez le premier mot", which led me to realize I should read the first word of each line after that in the poet's work.   
By doing that, i recieved 2 words "Cette" and  "Nuit".   
Additionally, the last line, "Utilisez la dernière "phrase cachée", pour valider cette épreuve" informed me that i need to use these words to validate the challenge.  
Password: "Cette Nuit".
