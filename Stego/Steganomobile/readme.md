After downloads a file, i recieved a txt file which have a line of number in there: '222-33-555-555-7-44-666-66-33'.    
We have a hint from statement about a phone number so it give me an idea about an original phone which type characters by number.

So i depened on these numbers to convert to a string of characters: 'c-e-l-l-p-h-o-n-e'.   
Password: "cellphone".
